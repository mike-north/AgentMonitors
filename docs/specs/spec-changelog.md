# Spec Changelog

This file records clarifications, contradiction resolutions, and structural changes to the
Agent Monitors spec set in `docs/specs/`.

## Usage

- Add entries when ambiguity is resolved or the intended contract changes.
- Prefer short entries tied to the numbered doc affected.
- If implementation behavior and desired behavior differ, say so explicitly.

## 2026-06-07 — Remove `event-kind` frontmatter field

- `event-kind` (and its runtime counterparts `eventKind` / `event_kind`) are **removed** from the
  schema and the entire pipeline. The field was never surfaced in a delivered signal and served no
  runtime purpose. Affected: frontmatter schema ([001 §3](./001-monitor-definition.md)), required
  fields for JSON Schema generation ([003 §2](./003-source-plugins.md)), `monitor_events` and
  `inbox_items` DB columns ([002 §5/§12](./002-runtime-delivery.md)), delivery meta key table
  ([006 §4.2](./006-agent-integration.md)), CLI scan output and filter options
  ([005 §5/§9](./005-cli-reference.md)). No DB migration — a local no-users project. Minor
  `@mike-north/core` changeset.

## 2026-06-04 — Flat-file monitor authoring; `name` optional

- Monitors may now be authored as a flat `.claude/monitors/<id>.md` file (id = filename), in
  addition to the folder form `<id>/MONITOR.md` (id = directory). The scanner discovers both;
  markdown assets nested inside a folder monitor are not treated as monitors
  ([001 §scanning](./001-monitor-definition.md)). Verified: `parse-monitor.ts` id derivation and
  `scan-monitors.ts` combined glob.
- `name` is now **optional** in frontmatter and defaults to the monitor id. Minor
  `@mike-north/core` changeset.

## 2026-06-02 — Channel transport, automated end-to-end UAT

- Added `experiments/channel-uat/` — an MCP-client harness that verifies the channel **push** path
  ([006 §4](./006-agent-integration.md)) end to end without a live Claude session or a
  channels-enabled org. It starts a real daemon + monitor, spawns `agentmonitors channel serve`,
  connects to it over stdio as the MCP host (injecting `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` / `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`
  exactly as Claude Code would), mutates the watched file, and asserts the `<channel>` push.
- Confirmed both delivery shapes: `normal` urgency pushes the coalesced reminder; `high` urgency
  pushes the concrete event (`event_count: 1`, `monitor_id`, `event_id`) after the ~15s settle.
- Retires the last G7 follow-up (the previously "manual, not CI-able" end-to-end UAT). Experiment-only
  (outside the workspace globs); no changeset.

## 2026-06-02 — Watch-mode source execution (G5)

- The runtime now drives continuous `watch()` for opt-in sources:
  `AgentMonitorRuntime.watchMonitors(monitorsDir, workspacePath)` consumes each watch-capable
  source's `AsyncIterable<Observation>` and funnels every yielded observation through the **same**
  notify dispatch → materialization → projection pipeline as `observe()` (extracted into a shared
  `ingest()` helper, which also records the `observation_history` audit row, so watch-mode
  observations are audited identically to ticked ones). Returns a `WatchHandle` whose `stop()` aborts
  and awaits the watchers ([002 §2.3](./002-runtime-delivery.md)). `daemon run` starts/stops watchers
  around its tick loop.
- A watched monitor is skipped by the tick loop's `observe()` (no double-processing); a watcher that
  throws outside its own abort is surfaced via `onError` and released so the tick loop resumes it.
- Added `ObservationContext.signal?: AbortSignal` (passed to `watch()` for teardown) and the exported
  `WatchHandle` type. Promoted **NP4** from "the runtime does not define watch-mode" to
  "watch-mode is opt-in and additive" ([000](./000-principles.md), [003 §2](./003-source-plugins.md)).
- Closes roadmap **G5**. No bundled source opts into `watch()` yet, but the path is exercised
  end-to-end (`libs/core/src/runtime/service.test.ts`). Minor `@mike-north/core` changeset
  (new `watchMonitors` method, `WatchHandle` type, `ObservationContext.signal` field).

## 2026-06-01 — Observation history audit trail (G6)

- The runtime now **writes `observation_history`** — for each due monitor per tick it records the
  outcome (`triggered` / `suppressed` / `no-change`) plus a `{ observed, emitted }` summary, via the
  new `RuntimeStore.recordObservationHistory` / `listObservationHistory`
  ([002 §"Persistence Schema"](./002-runtime-delivery.md)).
- Added a daemon IPC method `history.list` and the `agentmonitors monitor history [monitorId]`
  command to read it ([005 §6](./005-cli-reference.md)) — a "why didn't my monitor fire?" diagnostic.
- Closes roadmap **G6** (the dead table now has a write path **and** a reader). Runtime + CLI
  integration tests added; minor `@mike-north/core` changeset (new `RuntimeStore` methods, exported
  `ObservationHistoryRecord` / `ObservationHistoryQuery` / `ObservationOutcome` types, runtime write).

## 2026-06-01 — Channel transport, stage 3 (plugin packaging); G7 shipped

- Added `channel-plugin/` — a Claude Code channel plugin (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `.mcp.json`)
  that runs `agentmonitors channel serve`, plus a README with the prerequisites and the manual UAT
  command. Lives at the repo root (outside the `plugins/*` workspace glob, since it is a plugin
  manifest, not an npm package).
- Marks the channel transport ([006 §4](./006-agent-integration.md)) implemented and retires roadmap
  **G7**. Non-blocking follow-ups remain: the end-to-end manual UAT (channels are research-preview)
  and optional `object_key` meta (needs `DeliveryEventSummary` enrichment).

## 2026-06-01 — Channel transport, stage 2 (two-way ack)

- `agentmonitors channel serve` is now two-way: it declares `capabilities.tools` and exposes the
  **`agentmon_ack`** tool (`apps/cli/src/channel-ack.ts`), which routes through `events.ack` for the
  bound session — the bound session id is the "outbound gate" (006 §4.3). Tool arguments are
  validated defensively at the MCP boundary (`parseAckArgs`, unit-tested). Session resolution is
  shared between the poll loop and the ack tool. Marked [006 §4.3](./006-agent-integration.md)
  implemented; updated roadmap G7 (remaining: plugin packaging + manual UAT). CLI-only; no changeset.

## 2026-06-01 — Channel transport, stage 1 (one-way push)

- Shipped `agentmonitors channel serve` ([005 §13](./005-cli-reference.md)): an MCP **channel**
  server that binds via `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, polls `claimDelivery('turn-interruptible')` over
  the daemon socket, and pushes each settled claim as a `<channel>` event. Reuses the claim path, so
  claimed-state and cross-transport dedup come for free; a missing daemon is handled quietly (the
  hook path still delivers). The claim→event renderer is unit-tested.
- Clarified [006 §2](./006-agent-integration.md): the transport seam needs **no in-process
  `DeliveryTransport` refactor** — the channel transport is realized out-of-process over the daemon
  IPC surface. Marked [006 §4.1](./006-agent-integration.md) one-way push as implemented; updated
  roadmap G7 (stage 1 done; remaining: ack tool + packaging + manual UAT).
- `apps/cli` is changeset-exempt, so no changeset. Also corrected a stale `validate` status in the
  005 command inventory (full schema validation since G2).

## 2026-06-01 — Closed remaining test gaps (T2, T4; T1 retired)

- **T2** — added `RuntimeStore` snapshot tests (save/retrieve + isolation by
  `(workspace, monitor, objectKey)`, SP5) and a runtime test asserting `diffText` is computed
  against the prior snapshot when an object changes.
- **T4** — added standalone CLI integration tests for `schema generate` (and `-o` output) and the
  `session list` → `session close` lifecycle.
- Retired the already-shipped **T1** (`low` urgency, #21) from the roadmap; all tracked test gaps
  (T1–T4) are now closed. Test-only change — no changeset.

## 2026-06-01 — First-class observation change-kind; file-fingerprint create/delete (G3)

- Introduced a **source-agnostic `changeKind`** primitive on the core `Observation` contract
  (`created` / `modified` / `deleted` / `descoped`), exported as the `ChangeKind` type. `deleted`
  (information lost upstream) and `descoped` (still exists upstream, left the monitor's scope) are
  deliberately distinct so agents react differently — e.g. a pull request _deleted_ vs _closed_.
  See [003 §2.3](./003-source-plugins.md).
- The runtime copies `observation.changeKind` into the materialized event's `queryScope.changeKind`
  ([002 §5.1](./002-runtime-delivery.md)), so it is filterable without each source duplicating it.
- `file-fingerprint` is the first emitter: it now reports `created` / `modified` / `deleted` /
  `descoped` (stat-ing the path to distinguish a true disk deletion from a glob/config change),
  closing roadmap G3 — promoted [003 §3.3](./003-source-plugins.md) from limitation to current
  behavior. Minor changesets for `@mike-north/core` and `@mike-north/source-file-fingerprint`.

## 2026-05-31 — Channel transport binding confirmed (006 §4.4)

- Ran the `experiments/channel-probe` diagnostic against Claude Code 2.1.157 with the probe spawned
  **as an MCP server** (`--mcp-config`). Confirmed: the server receives `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`
  (= workspace), its cwd is the workspace, it **inherits `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`**, and `roots/list`
  returns the workspace root.
- Resolved the [006 §4.4](./006-agent-integration.md) open question: **session-level binding is
  available** (the MCP subprocess inherits the host session id), so it is now the documented
  preferred strategy, with workspace binding as fallback. Updated roadmap G7 (binding proof done;
  remaining work is the transport seam + channel server). The channel transport itself is still
  target (unbuilt); only the binding mechanism is confirmed.

## 2026-05-31 — Full per-source scope validation in `validate` (G2)

- Promoted [004 §2.2](./004-validation-testing.md) and [001 §8](./001-monitor-definition.md)
  from target to **current**: `validate` now performs full JSON Schema (draft-07) validation of
  each monitor's `scope` against its source's `scopeSchema`, not just required-field presence.
  Closes roadmap G2 (and test gap T3).
- Added the exported core helper `validateScope(scope, scopeSchema)`
  (`libs/core/src/schema/validate-scope.ts`); the CLI calls it (AP4/AP6).
- Validator is **`@cfworker/json-schema`**, chosen over ajv specifically because it validates by
  walking the schema at runtime rather than compiling with the `Function` constructor — safe under
  restrictive CSP / Workers-style environments. Minor `@mike-north/core` changeset.

## 2026-05-31 — Duplicate monitor IDs are now rejected (G1)

- Promoted [001 §4](./001-monitor-definition.md) from target to **current**: duplicate
  folder-derived monitor IDs are now a hard error, closing roadmap item G1.
- `scanMonitors` surfaces collisions via a new `ScanResult.duplicateIds`
  (`DuplicateMonitorId[]`) field; the runtime tick refuses to run on duplicates; `validate`
  exits non-zero and `scan` reports them. Enforces SP2. Regression tests added at the scanner,
  runtime, and CLI layers; minor `@mike-north/core` changeset included.

## 2026-05-31 — Agent integration & delivery transports

- Added normative [006-agent-integration.md](./006-agent-integration.md): a delivery-**transport**
  abstraction behind the adapter seam, covering the current hook-state transport and a **target**
  Claude Code **channel** transport. Recorded as roadmap item G7.
- Scoped the channel transport's binding model from evidence. A spawned MCP server can recover its
  **workspace** (`CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` / MCP `roots/list`). For **session** identity there is no
  `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID`, but a probe found `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` present in Claude Code's process
  environment; whether MCP-server subprocesses inherit it is the open question the one-way prototype
  (`experiments/channel-probe/`) resolves. Binding therefore prefers **session** scope when that
  variable is available and falls back to **workspace** scope (single-active-lead-session assumption,
  degrade on multi-lead); the hook-state transport remains the per-session-accurate surface either way.
- Established that channels are **optional and additive** (NP-CH): research-preview, version- and
  org-gated, so they must never become a delivery dependency. The hook-state transport stays the
  always-available default.

## 2026-05-31 — In-repo authoring pass

The numbered draft set was promoted into `docs/specs/` as the
canonical contract, verified against the code, and enriched. See
[maintainer-migration-notes.md](./maintainer-migration-notes.md) for the source mapping.

### Structure

- Established `docs/specs/` as the canonical location (previously only referenced as a plan).
- Added supporting docs: [README.md](./README.md), [glossary.md](./glossary.md),
  [roadmap.md](./roadmap.md).
- Added normative [005-cli-reference.md](./005-cli-reference.md) covering the full
  `agentmonitors` command surface.

### 001-monitor-definition.md

- Verified the `source` field constraint against `monitor-schema.ts`: the regex is
  `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$` (first character must be a lowercase letter), which is stricter than
  the prose "kebab-case". The doc now states the exact regex.

### 002-runtime-delivery.md

- Enriched with verified sections for the **daemon/IPC** layer, **agent-integration
  adapters** (`claudeCodeAdapter` lifecycle→hook mapping), and a **persistence-schema
  appendix** covering the real Drizzle/SQLite tables.
- Clarified that `daemon once` / a single tick runs **in-process without the Unix socket**;
  only `daemon run` serves the socket that `session`/`events`/`hook` round-trip through.
- Clarified that lead-only event projection is enforced as a post-query role filter, that
  `latestHighTitles` is capped at 5, and that computed diffs are capped at 20 changed lines.
- Recorded that `observation_history` is defined in the schema but has **no runtime write
  path** (current-vs-target; tracked as roadmap G6).

### 003-source-plugins.md

- Verified `api-poll` is **stateful**, that `text-diff` is its **default** change-detection
  strategy, that its `method` scope enum is limited to `GET`/`POST`, and that its
  `snapshot` carries `{ url, status, bodyLength, strategy }` rather than the full body.
- Clarified that `schedule` omits the `stateful` field entirely (rather than setting it
  `false`), and that `queryScope` values may be `string | string[]`.

### 004-validation-testing.md

- Replaced the external "FormSpec" style reference (from the source author's other project)
  with project-local guidance, since FormSpec does not exist in this repo.
- Mapped each required test scenario to the test file that covers it and flagged the
  uncovered ones (`low` urgency, snapshot persistence/isolation, `validate` failure paths,
  `schema generate` and standalone `session list|close` wiring). Tracked in
  [roadmap.md](./roadmap.md) as T1–T4.

### Carried forward from the prior draft set (2026-04-06)

- **000-principles.md** — established the numbered spec set as the canonical implementation
  contract; recorded the runtime/session event pipeline as authoritative delivery; recorded
  the legacy inbox lifecycle as a separate still-implemented model; made `low` urgency
  first-class.
- **001-monitor-definition.md** — split monitor authoring/frontmatter into its own doc; made
  duplicate monitor IDs a normative correctness requirement even though the scanner does not
  yet reject them; clarified single-root (no multi-root merge) evaluation.
- **002-runtime-delivery.md** — split runtime polling, persistence, session projection, and
  hook delivery into a dedicated contract; clarified unread/claimed/acknowledged as distinct;
  clarified that high urgency defaults to debounced delivery rather than immediate interrupt.
- **003-source-plugins.md** — split the source contract and bundled-source behavior into a
  dedicated doc; recorded `file-fingerprint` create/delete limitations; recorded
  plugin-management CLI commands as placeholders.
- **004-validation-testing.md** — clarified that `agentmonitors validate` performs partial
  source-specific validation rather than full per-source JSON Schema validation; defined the
  evidence hierarchy for resolving drift during the transition to the internal numbered specs.
