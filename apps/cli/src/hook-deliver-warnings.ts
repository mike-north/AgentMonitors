/**
 * Pure line-formatting for `hook deliver`'s always-on (non-`--debug`) stderr
 * diagnostics (issues #329, #420 P1).
 *
 * `hook-deliver-debug.ts` covers `--debug`-gated diagnosis — every line there
 * is silent unless the operator opts in. This module is different in kind:
 * it formats the lines that `hook deliver` writes to stderr on EVERY
 * invocation that hits the relevant branch, regardless of `--debug`. `hook
 * deliver`'s STDOUT contract stays unconditionally silent-on-idle (006 §5.1)
 * — the Claude Code host never sees stderr — but an operator polling
 * `hook deliver` manually while diagnosing a broken hook wire does.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately narrow: the four branches here are the ones whose
 * empty stdout is otherwise indistinguishable from "nothing pending" AND can
 * never resolve on their own —
 *   - a malformed / non-hook stdin payload (no `session_id`),
 *   - a `hook_event_name` that maps to no delivery lifecycle,
 *   - an enabled workspace with no per-workspace socket configured (#389 P2), and
 *   - an unresolvable host `session_id` (stale/mistyped; #329).
 * A payload that IS a real hook call but is merely held by the expected
 * high-urgency claim-settle window (the runtime debounces high-urgency
 * delivery for up to ~15s; empty output during that window is normal and MUST
 * NOT warn — 002 §9.1) stays silent, as does every other quiet-return branch
 * (disabled workspace, unreachable daemon, nothing pending, …), each of which
 * remains diagnosable via `--debug` (`hook-deliver-debug.ts`). The plugin only
 * wires `hook deliver` into `UserPromptSubmit` with a well-formed payload, so
 * none of these lines fire in normal operation — only on the manual/no-docs
 * path these diagnostics exist to unblock.
 *
 * @see ./commands/hook.ts (writes these lines to stderr, unconditionally, on
 *   the relevant branch)
 * @see ../../../docs/specs/006-agent-integration.md §5 (hook-deliver transport)
