# Roadmap & Known Gaps

> **Status:** Supporting (non-normative)
> **Covers:** the current→target gaps between the spec set and the implementation, as
> prioritizable work items

This is a planning surface, not a contract. Each item states what is **current**, what is
**target**, the governing spec/property, the affected files, and a **proof** (the test or
check that demonstrates the item is done). Every gap below was confirmed against the code
while authoring the numbered specs; the governing doc carries the normative statement.

Priority is a suggestion (P1 = highest). Re-rank freely — that is the point of this doc.

## Behavioral gaps

> G1 (reject duplicate monitor IDs) shipped — now current behavior, see
> [001 §4](./001-monitor-definition.md) and [spec-changelog.md](./spec-changelog.md).

> G2 (full per-source JSON Schema validation in `validate`) shipped — now current
> behavior via the exported core `validateScope` helper (backed by `@cfworker/json-schema`).
> See [004 §2.2](./004-validation-testing.md) and [spec-changelog.md](./spec-changelog.md).
> This also closed test gap T3 (`validate` failure paths).

> G3 (`file-fingerprint` create/delete events) shipped — and was generalized into a first-class,
> source-agnostic `changeKind` (`created`/`modified`/`deleted`/`descoped`) on the core `Observation`
> contract, persisted into the event `queryScope` by the runtime. See
> [003 §2.3 / §3.3](./003-source-plugins.md), [002 §5.1](./002-runtime-delivery.md), and
> [spec-changelog.md](./spec-changelog.md).

### G4 — Third-party source discovery & installation (P3)

- **Current:** `source search|install|update|remove` are placeholders that print a
  "not yet implemented" message; third-party plugins are a supported _architectural_ concept
  only.
- **Target:** a real plugin manager (discovery + install/update/remove) wired to the
  registry, or an explicit decision to keep manual installation and remove the placeholders.
- **Governs:** NP3 ([000](./000-principles.md)), [003 §7](./003-source-plugins.md),
  [005](./005-cli-reference.md).
- **Files:** `apps/cli/src/commands/source.ts`.
- **Proof:** integration tests for the chosen workflow; until then NP3 stays normative.

> G5 (watch-mode source execution) **shipped** — the runtime now drives continuous `watch()` for
> opt-in sources via `AgentMonitorRuntime.watchMonitors()` (started by `daemon run`), funnelling each
> yielded observation through the same notify/materialize/project pipeline as `observe()`; a watched
> monitor is skipped by the tick loop so it is never driven twice, and `stop()` aborts watchers via
> `context.signal`. No bundled source opts in yet, but the path is exercised end-to-end. See
> [NP4](./000-principles.md), [002 §2.3](./002-runtime-delivery.md), [003 §2](./003-source-plugins.md),
> and [spec-changelog.md](./spec-changelog.md).

> G6 (`observation_history`) **shipped** — the runtime now writes a per-tick audit row for each due
> monitor (`triggered` / `suppressed` / `no-change`) via `RuntimeStore.recordObservationHistory`, read
> back through `agentmonitors monitor history` ([002 §"Persistence Schema"](./002-runtime-delivery.md),
> [005 §6](./005-cli-reference.md)).

> G7 (Claude Code channel delivery transport) **shipped** — built out-of-process over the daemon IPC
> (no in-process core refactor), binding by the inherited `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`:
>
> - One-way push **and** the two-way `agentmon_ack` tool via `agentmonitors channel serve`
>   ([005 §13](./005-cli-reference.md), [006 §4](./006-agent-integration.md)); reusing `claimDelivery`
>   gives cross-transport dedup and the durable hook-path fallback for free.
> - An installable plugin: the channel MCP now ships inside the `agentmonitors` activation plugin at
>   `agent-plugins/agentmonitors/.mcp.json` (a colocated aipm marketplace; see [006 §5.6](./006-agent-integration.md)).
> - Binding confirmed empirically by `experiments/channel-probe` (006 §4.4).
> - End-to-end **push** verified by `experiments/channel-uat` — an MCP-client harness that drives a
>   real `channel serve` against a live daemon and asserts the `<channel>` push for both the
>   coalesced-reminder (normal) and concrete-event (high) paths, without needing a live Claude
>   session or a channels-enabled org.
>
> Non-blocking follow-ups: optional `object_key` meta (needs `DeliveryEventSummary`
> enrichment, [006 §4.2](./006-agent-integration.md)).

> G8 (`command-poll` source) **shipped** — the bundled package
> `@agentmonitors/source-command-poll` implements [003 §11](./003-source-plugins.md) verbatim:
> argv-only execution (never a shell), `text-diff`/`json-diff`/`exit-code` strategies, a 1 MiB stdout
> cap with stable truncated diffs, SIGTERM→SIGKILL timeout handling with no orphan processes,
> transition-edge `ok ↔ failing` health signals (nonzero exit with output is a result, not a
> failure), and `env` never persisted. Registered via `registerCoreSources`
> (`apps/cli/src/sources.ts`) with an `init --type command-poll` template
> (`apps/cli/src/commands/init.ts`). Proven by `plugins/source-command-poll/src/index.test.ts` (the
> §11.7 validation list, incl. the no-shell metacharacter test, the nonzero-exit-is-a-result test,
> the transition-edge failure tests, and the no-orphan-on-timeout guard) and CLI integration tests
> (`apps/cli/src/commands/cli.integration.test.ts`). See [003 §11](./003-source-plugins.md) and
> [spec-changelog.md](./spec-changelog.md). The cursor (§13) target remains unbuilt.

> G9 (keyed-collection change detection) **shipped** — the `change-detection.collection` mode of
> [003 §12](./003-source-plugins.md) is now current. The per-object diff (`created`/`modified`/
> `descoped` with stable `<monitor-objectKey>#<key>` ids) is implemented once as the shared core
> helper `diffKeyedCollection` (`libs/core/src/observation/keyed-collection.ts`, exported from
> `libs/core/src/index.ts`) and consumed by **both** `api-poll` and `command-poll`. `path` is a
> minimal `$.`-dotted path selecting exactly one array; `ignore-paths` strips churn fields before
> comparison; reordering/whitespace are inherently ignored; the baseline run emits nothing. The
> `collection` block requires `strategy: json-diff` and is rejected by `validate` under
> `text-diff`/`exit-code` (BP3). Proven by `libs/core/src/observation/keyed-collection.test.ts`
> (re-sorted → zero observations; one element changing → one `modified`; addition → `created`;
> removal → `descoped`, not `deleted`; `ignore-paths` suppression), per-source integration tests in
> each plugin's `index.test.ts`, and the `validate` rejection tests in
> `apps/cli/src/commands/cli.integration.test.ts`. See [003 §12](./003-source-plugins.md) and
> [spec-changelog.md](./spec-changelog.md).

### G10 — Post-processing pipeline stages + per-recipient seam (P2)

- **Current:** the runtime implements a subset of the locked pipeline as
  `Observe → Notify(≈Pace) → Materialize/Diff → Project → Deliver`, with the diff computed **once
  per object** against the latest stored snapshot ([002 §5.2](./002-runtime-delivery.md)) and then
  projected into each matching session ([002 §6](./002-runtime-delivery.md)) — a single **shared**
  baseline.
- **Target:** the full stage model and seam of
  [002 §1.1](./002-runtime-delivery.md) — `Observe → [Compose] → Shape → Pace → ⟦seam⟧ → Diff → Interpret → Deliver → [React]` — with **Shape** (render before Pace and before Diff), **Pace**
  modes, and a **per-recipient Diff** computed against each recipient's own baseline/cursor right of
  the shared/per-recipient seam (so divergent-baseline recipients each hear the right span; fan-out
  multiplies only genuinely per-baseline work, capability C15). The per-stage detail lands with the
  follow-on Shape / Interpret / baseline-Diff / Pace work.
- **Governs:** PP3, AP3 ([000](./000-principles.md)), [002 §1.1](./002-runtime-delivery.md),
  the capability study ([§S1, §S4, §S5](../product/monitoring-capability-exercises.md); rows
  C6/C15/C43).
- **Files:** `libs/core/src/runtime/service.ts`, `libs/core/src/runtime/store.ts`,
  `libs/core/src/runtime/diff.ts` (and the per-recipient baseline persistence).
- **Proof:** per-stage tests landing with the follow-on work (a divergent-baseline fan-out test
  proving two recipients with different last-seen points receive different spans from one shared
  observation); until then [002 §1.1](./002-runtime-delivery.md) stays _target_.

> G11 (source contract: snapshots-not-diffs + composite observation) **shipped** — both
> [003 §2.5](./003-source-plugins.md) and [003 §2.6](./003-source-plugins.md) are now **current**.
> §2.5 (sources return current-state snapshots + `nextState`; the runtime is the sole producer of the
> consumer-baseline diff, PP3/AP3) is reaffirmed on the `Observation`/`ObservationResult` types
> (`libs/core/src/observation/types.ts`) and proven against the bundled `file-fingerprint` source
> driven through the real runtime (`plugins/source-file-fingerprint/src/index.test.ts`,
> "snapshots-not-diffs (003 §2.5)"). §2.6 (composite observation, C40) ships as the `api-poll`
> `change-detection.composite` mode — N sub-resource calls reduced into one deterministic snapshot
> under one `objectKey` (`plugins/source-api-poll/src/composite.ts`,
> `plugins/source-api-poll/src/index.test.ts`). See [spec-changelog.md](./spec-changelog.md). Did not
> touch `runtime/service.ts` or `monitor-schema.ts` (the runtime already owned the diff).

> G12 (Scheduled-rollup Pace mode) **shipped** — `notify.strategy: rollup` is now current. The
> schema accepts a `rollup` monitor with a required five-field cron `window` (optional `timezone`,
> default UTC) and rejects `strategy: rollup` missing `window` (`rollupNotifySchema`,
> `libs/core/src/schema/monitor-schema.ts`). The runtime's `dispatchRollup()`
> (`libs/core/src/runtime/service.ts`) accumulates every observation into a durable
> `notifyState.pendingRollup` batch (`PendingRollupState`, `libs/core/src/runtime/types.ts`,
> persisted in `monitor_state.notify_state`), evaluates the `window` cron each tick via
> `cronMatchesDate`, and on a non-empty window flushes the whole batch (one `monitor_events` row
> per accumulated observation) and clears accumulation; an empty window produces no delivery. The
> batch survives a daemon restart and reuses the issue-#109 `effectiveUrgency` hydration backfill
> (BP1). All five proof criteria are covered: schema accept/reject
> (`libs/core/src/schema/monitor-schema.test.ts`) and `validate` accept/reject through the real CLI
> (`apps/cli/src/commands/cli.integration.test.ts`); durable accumulation, window flush+clear,
> empty-window no-delivery, and restart-safety (`libs/core/src/runtime/service.test.ts`, "rollup
> Pace mode"). See [001 §3.6](./001-monitor-definition.md),
> [002 §4.4–§4.5](./002-runtime-delivery.md), and [spec-changelog.md](./spec-changelog.md).

> G13 (author-declared baseline strategy) **shipped** — the `baseline-strategy` frontmatter field is
> now accepted by `agentmonitors validate` and enforced by the runtime Diff stage. `incremental`
> (default) materializes every observation in a catch-up span as its own ordered delta (backward
> compatible, the degenerate "one event per observation" behavior); `net` collapses the span per
> `objectKey` to a **single** net delta (the last observation of each object's run, diffed against the
> prior snapshot baseline), discarding intermediate churn. Omitting the field is `incremental`.
> Implemented as `baselineStrategySchema` (`libs/core/src/schema/monitor-schema.ts`,
> `z.enum(['incremental','net']).default('incremental')`) and `collapseToNetSpan()` in
> `ingest()` (`libs/core/src/runtime/service.ts`). Proven by the schema tests (accept
> `incremental`/`net`, default to `incremental`, reject unknown), the runtime tests ("baseline
> strategy (G13, 002 §1.1.7)" — `net` → one net delta, `incremental` → N ordered deltas, omitting ≡
> `incremental`), and the `validate` CLI integration tests. See
> [001 §3.7](./001-monitor-definition.md#37-baseline-strategy-current),
> [002 §1.1.7](./002-runtime-delivery.md#117-baseline-strategy-per-recipient-diff-semantics-current),
> and [spec-changelog.md](./spec-changelog.md). The **full per-recipient-baseline seam** (two
> recipients at divergent stored baselines each receiving an independently-spanned Diff) remains
> tracked under **G10**; `baseline-strategy` is the author-declared mode that seam will apply per
> recipient.

### G14 — Interpret stage: cheap agentic digest + significance gate via the user's own AI tool (P2)

- **Current:** the runtime delivers a textual diff with no agentic reading; there is no Interpret
  stage, no `prose`-triggered summarization, no agentic significance gate, and no adapter for invoking
  an external AI tool. Suppression today is only deterministic (debounce/throttle, and the _target_
  `cel` gate of [002 §1.1.6](./002-runtime-delivery.md#116-author-declared-payload-form)).
- **Target:** the optional Interpret stage of
  [002 §1.1.8](./002-runtime-delivery.md#118-interpret-a-cheap-agentic-digest-via-the-users-own-ai-tool),
  invoked **only** for `payload.form: prose` ([001 §5.2](./001-monitor-definition.md#52-payload-form-target)):
  (a) it runs **after** the per-recipient Diff, on the per-recipient delta, producing a **cheap digest**
  sized to the span (C10) and an optional **agentic significance gate** (suppress-if-not-substantive,
  C11/C38); (b) it runs by **shelling out to the user's own installed AI tool** (e.g. `claude -p …`) —
  **Agent Monitors ships no model and holds no credentials** (C45); (c) the tool invocation is
  **host-agnostic, behind an adapter interface, never in the runtime core**
  ([002 §11.1](./002-runtime-delivery.md#111-the-agentruntimeadapter-contract), [006 §2.1](./006-agent-integration.md#21-the-interpret-adapter-is-upstream-of-transports-not-a-transport));
  (d) it is **best-effort** — a tool failure falls back to the deterministic `rendered` artifact and is
  recorded; (e) **every suppress/deliver decision is recorded and explainable** on the per-recipient
  surface (`session_event_state`, via `monitor explain` [§10.7](./002-runtime-delivery.md#107-monitor-pipeline-diagnosis)),
  so "why nothing fired" is inspectable (C12).
- **Governs:** PP4, AP3 ([000](./000-principles.md)),
  [002 §1.1.8](./002-runtime-delivery.md#118-interpret-a-cheap-agentic-digest-via-the-users-own-ai-tool),
  [006 §2.1](./006-agent-integration.md#21-the-interpret-adapter-is-upstream-of-transports-not-a-transport),
  the capability study ([§S4, §S5 item 3](../product/monitoring-capability-exercises.md); rows
  C45/C10/C11/C38/C12). It is the per-stage Interpret detail under the
  [§1.1](./002-runtime-delivery.md#11-post-processing-pipeline-model) umbrella that **G10** names.
- **Files:** `libs/core/src/adapter/` (the AI-tool invocation adapter, host-agnostic boundary),
  `libs/core/src/runtime/service.ts` (the post-Diff Interpret invocation + best-effort fallback),
  `libs/core/src/runtime/types.ts` (the per-recipient Interpret decision recorded for projection).
- **Proof:** with the user's AI tool replaced by a deterministic fake adapter: (a) a `prose` monitor
  invokes the adapter and a non-`prose` monitor never does; (b) a delta the fake classifies
  "substantive" yields a `prose` delivery whose digest is the fake's output; (c) a delta classified
  "not substantive" yields **no** delivery and a per-recipient suppression reason retrievable via
  `monitor explain` (C12); (d) when the fake adapter throws, the recipient still receives the §1.1.5
  `rendered` artifact (best-effort fallback) and the failure is recorded; (e) the runtime never reads a
  model credential or ships a model — the only AI call is the adapter shell-out. Until then
  [002 §1.1.8](./002-runtime-delivery.md#118-interpret-a-cheap-agentic-digest-via-the-users-own-ai-tool)
  and [006 §2.1](./006-agent-integration.md#21-the-interpret-adapter-is-upstream-of-transports-not-a-transport)
  stay _target_.

### G15 — Deterministic Shape stage: derived facts + render-then-diff + payload form (P2)

- **Current:** the runtime computes a textual diff over the raw `snapshotText` ([002 §5.2](./002-runtime-delivery.md))
  and delivers the monitor body + diff as a textual payload. There is no deterministic compute of
  derived/relative facts, no explicit render-to-artifact step, and no author-declared payload form;
  no `shape`/`payload` frontmatter exists.
- **Target:** the deterministic Shape stage of
  [002 §1.1.4–§1.1.6](./002-runtime-delivery.md#114-shape-deterministic-derived-facts), authored via
  [001 §5.1–§5.2](./001-monitor-definition.md#51-shape-declaration-target):
  (a) **derived facts** computed as a pure function of `(shaped snapshot, injected now)` on the shared
  side of the seam, before Pace/Diff (C41); (b) **render** the shaped state to a stable, diffable
  text artifact and **diff that artifact**, not the raw source (C42/C43); (c) an **author-declared
  payload form** (`prose | structured | artifact | rendered`) with a turnkey **jq/CEL** transform over
  canonical JSON for the `structured` form (C46). Sources surface the raw facts these consume and do
  **not** pre-compute them ([003 §2.7](./003-source-plugins.md)).
- **Governs:** PP3, AP3 ([000](./000-principles.md)),
  [001 §5.1–§5.2](./001-monitor-definition.md#51-shape-declaration-target),
  [002 §1.1.4–§1.1.6](./002-runtime-delivery.md#114-shape-deterministic-derived-facts),
  [003 §2.7](./003-source-plugins.md), the capability study
  ([§S1, §S2 areas C/E/G, §S3 Tier 1, §S5 item 5](../product/monitoring-capability-exercises.md); rows
  C41/C42/C43/C46). It is the per-stage Shape detail under the [§1.1](./002-runtime-delivery.md#11-post-processing-pipeline-model)
  umbrella that **G10** names.
- **Files:** `libs/core/src/schema/monitor-schema.ts` (the `shape`/`payload` frontmatter),
  `libs/core/src/runtime/service.ts`, `libs/core/src/runtime/diff.ts` (render-then-diff), and a
  deterministic transform evaluator (jq/CEL).
- **Proof:** a fixed-`now` derived-facts test (a defer threshold crossing yields exactly `revealed`,
  one minute earlier yields none — proving purity over `(snapshot, now)`); a byte-stable render test
  (same shaped state → identical artifact → no phantom diff; one crossed threshold → exactly one added
  `revealed` line); a payload-form test (`structured` + a `jq` projection yields the projected fields,
  `rendered` yields the text artifact, a malformed transform fails `validate`). Until then
  [001 §5.1–§5.2](./001-monitor-definition.md#51-shape-declaration-target) and
  [002 §1.1.4–§1.1.6](./002-runtime-delivery.md#114-shape-deterministic-derived-facts) stay _target_.

> The cursor protocol ([003 §13](./003-source-plugins.md)) is deliberately **not** a roadmap item:
> per #81 it is designed only as far as a sketch, to be fully specified if measured poll cost ever
> justifies it.

## Test gaps

All test gaps tracked from [004 §3](./004-validation-testing.md) are now closed:

- **T1** — `low` urgency acceptance: added to the schema test loop
  (`libs/core/src/schema/monitor-schema.test.ts`).
- **T2** — snapshot persistence & isolation: `RuntimeStore` save/retrieve/isolation tests plus a
  runtime diff-on-change test (SP5, [002 §5.2](./002-runtime-delivery.md)).
- **T3** — `validate` failure paths: closed alongside G2 (unknown-source + schema-violation
  integration tests).
- **T4** — `schema generate` / `session list|close` CLI wiring: standalone CLI integration tests.

## How to retire an item

When an item ships: move the normative statement in its governing doc from _current_ to
_target-achieved_ (drop the "not yet" framing), add the proving test, record the change in
[spec-changelog.md](./spec-changelog.md), then delete the item here.
