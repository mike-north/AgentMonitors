Redeliver hook events omitted by the 4000-char context cap (fixes silent high-urgency signal loss).

A `turn-interruptible` high-urgency claim used to mark the **full** settled candidate set claimed before the length-bounded hook-deliver transport rendered and truncated it, so events truncated out of the 4000-char `additionalContext` were marked claimed yet never re-delivered at the next context event — durable signal that stayed unread but was never surfaced again.

The claimed set now equals the rendered set: the transport previews the settled high-urgency delivery without mutating state (`AgentMonitorRuntime.previewSettledHighDelivery`), sizes how many whole event blocks fit under the cap, and claims exactly that many via the new `maxEvents` argument on `AgentMonitorRuntime.claimDelivery`. The deferred remainder stays pending and re-delivers in order at the next context event; every event remains unread until explicitly acknowledged (claiming ≠ acking). Uncapped callers (the channel transport) are unchanged.
