Add `agentmonitors doctor` — a unified, diagnose-only workspace health check. It runs a named sequence of checks (project enabled, monitors directory found, every monitor validates, daemon reachable, lead session present, and per-monitor health) and prints a per-monitor rollup (id, source type, cadence, last-observed, next-due, last-event, and unread/claimed/acknowledged counts for the workspace's lead session — or an explicit never-observed / no-lead-session marker). Each check reports pass/fail/skip with an actionable remediation; doctor exits 0 only when every check passes. Like `monitor explain`, it reads persisted state in-process, so the per-monitor rollup still works (and says so) when the daemon is down. `--format json` emits a stable machine-readable shape documented in the CLI reference. The reusable durable-state diagnosis is exposed on the core runtime as `AgentMonitorRuntime.doctorReport()` (host-agnostic).
