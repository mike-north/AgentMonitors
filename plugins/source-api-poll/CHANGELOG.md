### Minor Changes

- f6bc858: Add composite-observation mode to `api-poll` (003 §2.6)

  `api-poll` can now assemble **one** observation from **many** sub-resource calls under a single `objectKey`. A monitor configures `change-detection.composite` with an `object-key` and a list of `parts` (each an `id` + `url`); `observe()` fetches every part within one cycle and reduces them into one stable, deterministic composite `snapshotText` (parts rendered sorted by `id`, so call ordering never churns the snapshot). The runtime diffs that single composite snapshot against the consumer's baseline exactly as it would a single-call snapshot — the source returns a current-state snapshot, never a pre-diffed delta (003 §2.5).

  A failed underlying call fails the whole observation (the prior baseline is preserved); `change-detection.composite` and `change-detection.collection` are mutually exclusive. Backward compatible: the top-level `url` modes are unchanged, and a monitor with neither `url` nor `composite` is still rejected.

- 8dbda37: `api-poll` change-detection robustness: non-2xx responses error instead of baselining, and `json-diff` warns on non-JSON bodies (Refs #219, #220)

  **Non-2xx responses are now errored observations, not silent baselines (#220).** Previously
  `api-poll` established its change-detection baseline from **any** HTTP response body, including a
  `401` from a missing/invalid bearer token or a `500` error page — so a misconfigured-auth monitor
  appeared to "work" while silently diffing error pages. For the `text-diff` and `json-diff` strategies,
  a non-2xx status now throws a status-bearing error (`api-poll received HTTP <status> from <url> —
check auth/url; not establishing a baseline on an error response`). The runtime records the tick as
  `errored` (no baseline advance, prior baseline preserved), `daemon once`/`run` report it,
  `monitor history` shows `errored`, and `monitor test` reports `Observation failed: … HTTP <status>`.
  2xx responses baseline/diff exactly as before. **Exception:** the `status-code` strategy still treats
  a non-2xx as a legitimate observed signal (the status is the watched object), so 200 → 5xx detection
  is unchanged.

  **`json-diff` against a non-JSON body now warns (#219).** When `change-detection.strategy: json-diff`
  is configured but the fetched body does not parse as JSON, the source attaches a non-fatal warning to
  the `ObservationResult` (the new optional `ObservationResult.warnings` field) and `agentmonitors
monitor test` prints it, steering the author to `text-diff` for HTML/plain-text pages instead of
  silently degrading to text comparison. The `api-poll` scaffold (`agentmonitors init`) and the
  authoring docs now state strategy-by-content-type inline: `text-diff` for HTML/plain pages, `json-diff`
  for JSON APIs.

- b1bb206: `api-poll` infers the change-detection strategy from the response `Content-Type` (Refs #230)

  `change-detection.strategy` is now **optional**. When it is omitted, `api-poll` infers the strategy
  from the response `Content-Type`: a JSON media type (`application/json` or any structured-syntax
  `+json` suffix, e.g. `application/ld+json`) → `json-diff`; everything else — `text/html`,
  `text/plain`, or a missing/unknown `Content-Type` → `text-diff`. The common "watch a web page" case is
  now zero-config: drop the `change-detection` block entirely and the source picks `text-diff` for an
  HTML page and `json-diff` for a JSON API automatically.

  **An explicit `change-detection.strategy` always wins** — it is used verbatim, with no inference and no
  Content-Type override (user specification is absolute). An explicit `json-diff` against an HTML page
  stays `json-diff` (and still triggers the existing #219 json-diff-on-non-JSON warning); an explicit
  `text-diff` against a JSON body stays `text-diff`. The #219 warning now fires **only** for the explicit
  `json-diff` case — an inferred strategy never warns, because inference picks `json-diff` solely for JSON
  `Content-Type`s and so never mismatches the body.

  The `api-poll` scaffold (`agentmonitors init --type api-poll`) and the authoring docs now show the
  zero-config "watch a page" example and document that `change-detection` is optional and inferred, with
  an explicit override honored. No public-type change.

### Patch Changes

- 5e83550: Redact credentials, query strings, and fragments from URLs surfaced in diagnostics. This now covers both the `json-diff` non-JSON warning and the non-2xx HTTP error messages (single-URL and composite-part), which are persisted durably to observation history — so a credential-bearing URL no longer leaks on the common 401/403 failure path.
- 1836f04: DX polish (issue #153): validate output consistency, urgency error wording, api-poll feedback
  - **validate**: invalid monitors now display the monitor ID (matching valid-monitor output) instead of the full file path; passing a file path shows a `monitor test` pointer
  - **core**: inverted urgency range error no longer duplicates the field name (`urgency: range "high..normal" is inverted` instead of `urgency: urgency range …`)
  - **api-poll `monitor test`**: HTTP status and response body size are now printed after the baseline so authors can spot bad URLs immediately
  - **api-poll observe**: Node `fetch` errors now propagate the underlying network cause (ECONNREFUSED, ENOTFOUND, timeout) in the message, visible in `monitor explain` output
