/**
 * Static parity check for issue #270 ("Prove and document hooks-only (no-MCP)
 * operation as a first-class mode").
 *
 * This is DELIBERATELY separate from the "hooks-only delivery parity"
 * integration test in `cli.integration.test.ts`, which proves the full
 * lifecycle works with ZERO reference to the channel/MCP code path. This file
 * covers the other half of acceptance criterion 2 (capability parity): it
 * inspects channel.ts's SOURCE TEXT via `readFileSync` — it never imports or
 * executes channel.ts, so no `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` is loaded and no MCP
 * server is started anywhere in this file — to confirm that the `agentmon_ack`
 * tool handler and the channel's outbound push are wired to the exact same
 * daemon-IPC client functions (`acknowledgeEventsClient` /
 * `claimDeliveryClient` in `runtime-client.ts`) that the hooks-only
 * `events ack` / `hook deliver` CLI commands call.
 *
 * That shared plumbing is what makes the hooks-only lifecycle proven in
 * `cli.integration.test.ts` a genuine substitute for the MCP tool's
 * capability — not just a superficially similar command: both transports
 * drive the identical daemon IPC methods (`events.ack`, `hook.claim`),
 * exactly as 006 §2's "realization" note describes ("the transport boundary
 * is the daemon IPC surface, not a new core type").
 *
 * @see docs/specs/006-agent-integration.md §2 and §4.3 (the agentmon_ack tool)
